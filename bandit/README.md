Bandit
======

Bandit is a simple SSH based game that teaches some basics about the Linux
command line, common programs and shell scripting. There is some use of the
network, cron, file permissions etc.

My notes and solutions are found in solutions.md. Where possible I'm trying to
be as succinct as possible and stick to only shell scripting (no python).
